# swift-csv-import
Quick and dirty csv parser in Swift

There's nothing elegant about this, but the data I'm reading is pretty ugly, too.  Inspired by https://makeapppie.com/2016/05/30/how-to-read-csv-files-from-the-web-in-swift/, but shares little code with it.

Use this at your own risk; maybe it'll help if you find yourself with import data that chokes the more formal csv libraries like I did.
